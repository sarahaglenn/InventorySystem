# Overview

This program implements a basic inventory tracker. Users can add new items, view the current inventory, update item details, or remove items from the inventory as needed."

I developed this program to become familiar with C++. Having previously written similar programs in other languages, this project provided an opportunity to compare and contrast C++ with the languages Iâ€™ve worked with before.
