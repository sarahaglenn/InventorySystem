# Overview

This program implements a simple inventory tracking system, allowing items to be created, added, viewed, and updated. Users can modify the inventory by updating or removing items as needed.

I developed this program to become familiar with C++. Having previously written similar programs in other languages, this project provided an opportunity to compare and contrast C++ with the languages Iâ€™ve worked with before.
