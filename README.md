# Overview

This program implements a simple inventory tracking system, allowing items to be created, added, viewed, and updated. Users can modify the inventory by updating or removing items as needed.

I developed this program to become familiar with C++. Having previously written similar programs in other languages, this project provided an opportunity to compare and contrast C++ with the languages I’ve worked with before.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
